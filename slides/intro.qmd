# GPT

- OpenAI's GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) models have been trained to understand natural language and code. 

- GPTs provide text outputs in response to their inputs.

## What is a prompt?

- The inputs to GPTs are also referred to as "**prompts**". 

- Designing a prompt is essentially how you ‚Äúprogram‚Äù a GPT model, usually by providing instructions or some examples of how to successfully complete a task.





```{python}
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Where was it played?"}
    ]
)
```
