# Setup

## API key and Python libaries


```{python}
from IPython.display import display, HTML
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())  # read local .env file

openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```


## GPT-3.5 Turbo vs GPT-4

- For cost efficiency reasons, we will use OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model and the [chat completions endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat). 

- However, you can simply replace `model="gpt-3.5-turbo"`with `model="gpt-4"` in the helper function


## Helper function {.smaller}

- This helper function will make it easier to use prompts and look at the generated outputs:


```{python}


def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0,  # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]


```

# Iterative Prompt Improvement

## Issue: Too long {.smaller .scrollable}

- The text is too long 

- Limit the number of words/sentences/characters.

## Issue: Too long {.smaller .scrollable}

```{python}
# | output-location: fragment
len(response)
```

## Issue: Wrong details {.smaller .scrollable}

- Text focuses on the wrong details

- Ask it to focus on the aspects that are relevant to the intended audience.

## Issue 3: No Table {.smaller .scrollable} 

- Description needs a table of dimensions

- Ask it to extract information and organize it in a table.
